# HEP Data Science @ SMU

Modules for a data science program in a HEP/particle physics class at SMU

This repository is home to Jupyter/Python notebook and other resources, arranged into modules, that can be used to conduct a data science portion of a HEP/Particle Physics course. This is implemented at SMU when the course is instructed by the lead author of this repository (Stephen Sekula).

The modules expect some familiarity already with Python, so it is important before utilizing any materials here that students already have a pre-requisite of some education in Python as a programming language. This can be done by the instructor or by requiring a Python programming course first.

The modules are arranged in increasing order of complexity, from "Basic Statistics and Probability" up to "Machine Learning for HEP". Each module is designed to be utilized for one ~90-minute period or one-and-a-half ~60-minute periods. Mix-and-match as needed.

## Curriculum

For the content of this course please see [`SYLLABUS.md`](https://github.com/stephensekula/smu-hep-data-science/blob/master/SYLLABUS.md)

## Software and Tools

This course will teach both the statistical and machine learning techniques of data science that are applicable to experimental physics, in addition to modern computational tools. Below are some of the software tools that you are encouraged to use and explore.

### Languages and Analysis Frameworks

- [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) ([CERN](https://home.cern/)'s modular scientific software C++ framework)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Statistical Analysis and Visualization Libraries

- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)

### Scientific Software Distributions and Package Managers

- The [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) distribution
- The [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager (included in Anaconda)
