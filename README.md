# SMU HEP Data Science Modules

This repository is home to Jupyter/Python notebook and other resources, arranged into modules, that can be used to conduct a data science portion of a HEP/Particle Physics course. This is implemented at SMU when the course is instructed by the lead author of this repository (Stephen Sekula).

The modules expect some familiarity already with Python, so it is important before utilizing any materials here that students already have a pre-requisite of some education in Python as a programming language. This can be done by the instructor or by requiring a Python programming course first.

The modules are arranged in increasing order of complexity, from "Basic Statistics and Probability" up to "Machine Learning for HEP". Each module is designed to be utilized for one ~90-minute period or one-and-a-half ~60-minute periods. Mix-and-match as needed.
